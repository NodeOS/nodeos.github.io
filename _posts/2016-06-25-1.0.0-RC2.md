Just exactly one month after my degree thesis (with distinction, f*ck yeah ;-) ) and with a lot of nights without sleep, we have available [NodeOS 1.0.0-RC2](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/releases/tag/v1.0.0-RC2).

There has been some problems lately with the packages and the build process, but they are due to the heavy changes on the architecture that I hope they are going to be better for the future. The main one, is the split of the different layers on independent, isolated and autonomous projects that are themselves published on NPM, but also (and that's the important part) they have their own tests [passing on SemaphoreCI](https://semaphoreci.com/nodeos) and configured to work with [GreenKeeper](http://greenkeeper.io), so when we'll move to 1.0.0 final we'll be able to work on a real Rolling Release distro, and also there have been suggestion to [include an autoupdater](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/issues/247) on NodeOS itself. As an implementation detail, these layers and submodules (like [qemu](https://github.com/NodeOS/qemu), that it's now [published on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qemu)) use extensively the [prebuild-install](https://github.com/mafintosh/prebuild-install) module to distribute prebuild images of their components, so no more pop-corn & movies to build NodeOS but just only a coffee. Yes, build process it's _blasingly fast_, and there's also a lot of room for improvement so we could end up blurrying the line between install and compile times by merging both processes ;-)

Other important change due to the increasing number of installing problems is the movement to npm3 and deprecation of npm2, so now build process is deterministic, faster and use less memory (also in NodeOS disk images, that have decreased ;-) ). Only drawback is that since npm3 considers the `install` process a one-time execution it's needed to split the install of the dependencies (`npm install`) and the generation of the NodeOS image (`npm run build`), but this also allow better flexibility and also remove the need of network connection when building the system since all the modules included on the NodeOS images has been set as dependencies of the NodeOS module itself, so they are getting cached for later.

But probably the most important change is Node.js, because not only it has got [it's own npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodejs) downloading prebuild binaries based on musl (maybe we should propose to Node.js org to host and distribute them side-by-side with their glibc ones?), but also it has been upgraded to bleeding edge 6.2.2! :-D There has been some problems because `/proc` was not being mounted and [it's needed by musl](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7175#issuecomment-227170756), but thanks to it I give the chance to do some improvements to `nodeos-init` and now it's easier to use and robust, cleanly clossing the system itself on shut-down :-)

Let's more to 1.0.0! :-D
