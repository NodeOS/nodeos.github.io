As some of you would already know if you follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheNodeOS), last Tuesday I was giving a keynote about NodeOS on the [Charles Third University Linux Users Group](http://www.gul.es/), and finally I've got the [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9fEpRL8W1SPZUFkeGNDYk1RSlE/view?usp=sharing) of the keynote ready to be downloaded :-)

And in other news... :-P I have been fiddleing the last days with [coverdeeps](https://github.com/piranna/coverdeeps),  a little tool to check the global test coverage of a project and all its dependencies, since they are important (or more!) than the main project. It's currently limited to project that are already published on the npm registry and using [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) for test coverage publishing so it's really pesimist about the results, but it's a good beginning the NodeOS objective to being an OS (the first one?) with a perfect score of [100% test coverage](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/issues/75) :-)
