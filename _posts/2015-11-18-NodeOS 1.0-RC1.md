It has been a long time, but now that [all the core functionality is ready](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/issues/37) being only a matter of some tune-ups and add some external projects like find a suitable `git` client or improve [nsh](https://github.com/groundwater/node-bin-nsh), now we can say it: we have a [release candidate](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/releases/tag/v1.0-RC1) :-D

The last weeks there has been a lot of work to make this happen, like adding support for LXC containers using [vagga](https://github.com/tailhook/vagga) and re-enabling support for Docker, but also work to make [all the dependencies downloaded using Node.js instead of bash scripts](https://github.com/piranna/download-manager) (and a lot of fixes on several projects to make it work like [download](https://github.com/kevva/download), [tar-stream](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream), [jsdiff](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff) or [vinyl-fs](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-fs)). Next step, made the build scripts also in Javascript :-)

We have also made it possible to test independently the cross-compiled Node.js binary by using [QEmu user mode](https://wiki.debian.org/QemuUserEmulation) so we can detect build failures in an earlier stage, and improved memory consumption by using [node-kexec](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-kexec) both on [usrbinenv](https://github.com/piranna/usrbinenv) and [logon](https://github.com/piranna/logon), although this is a point that still needs to be improved. But best of all... we have network enabled by default! :-D  Only dhcp at this moment and the wire needs to be plugged on boot to fetch the address and DNS servers, but it's just enought to start fiddling around.

As a side note, I've inscribed NodeOS this year both on the spanish national [Free Software Universitary Championship](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org/1516/proyectos/8) and the Granada University[Free Projects Competition](http://osl.ugr.es/bases-de-los-premios-a-proyectos-libres-de-la-ugr), so let's cross our fingers to see if this year we won again! :-P
