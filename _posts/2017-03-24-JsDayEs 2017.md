As you would already probably now I was candidate for the [JsDayEs 2017](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/issues/278#issuecomment-273422673)... Ok, now it's oficial: [I will talk about NodeOS](http://2017.jsday.es/es/#5740078466859008/99984001) at one of the biggest Javascript events here at Spain :-D And crazy of me, I will do it in english, so it will be the perfect time to sumarize and finally have some documentation of NodeOS internal in english :-)

Now it's time to clean-up a bit and pulish the project due this ocasion so we can be able to atract more collaborators, so I have two questions for you:

1. what do you think it's needed to do in the current NodeOS status to move it forward? From my mind, the only final tips for the final 1.0 release are the git client, fix nsh to allow interactive sessions, and probably update the website.
2. what do you want I talk about explicitly at the conference? :-) My initial intention is to talk about the story and architecture of NodeOS and what problems had surfaced during its development.

Anything else? :-)
