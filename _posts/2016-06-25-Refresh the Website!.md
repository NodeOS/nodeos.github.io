Hi! Are you a front-end web developer? Now is your chance for you and your buddies to contribute to NodeOS (without having to decipher underlying technology in the build process; double win!)

We're redesigning our website and would love to have the talent's of all the developers combined! The first step, of course, would be to design a new page so let's use this thread and create a new idea. You may propose:
- Theme idea's
- Template ideas (you can sketch, or paste screenshots)
- Web frameworks (like bootstrap) that we should (or shouldn't) use, and why

Looking forward to getting this going with you all! Tell all your friends!
