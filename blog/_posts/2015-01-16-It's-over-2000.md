[![It's over 2000!!!](NodeOs - 2004 Stargazers.png)](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/stargazers)

2004 stargazers in GitHub
[and counting](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/stargazers). *Awesome*.

This huge milestone has come in a good moment, since now NodeOS is being able to
be cross-compiled both for x86 32 & 64 bits and support for Raspberry Pi is in
the short term roadmap, and also testing support has greatly improved (yes, we
can checking that
[the generated images actually works](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/blob/master/node_modules/nodeos-barebones/scripts/test)
! :-D ), so maybe the next logical step is to try to compile and test them on
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/recent) or any other online
[CI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) service... :-)

Problem is, the [Big Red Button](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_red_button)
script spend three hours to compile everything X-D
