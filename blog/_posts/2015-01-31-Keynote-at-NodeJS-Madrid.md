title: Keynote at NodeJS Madrid
author: Jesús Leganés Combarro "piranna"

The last tuesday 27 I was doing a keynote about NodeOS at the
[NodeJS Madrid group](http://www.meetup.com/Node-js-Madrid/events/219754655/)
and the reception was really great, being one of the events with more assintants
of the group :-D and the ones that were not surprised about the posibilities of
the project did have face of not understand anything, so it's a good sign :-P

The ones that understood what's the purposse of the project (the most of them
were just web developers without system programming skills) had some interesting
questions, mostly regarding security of the system regarding other Linux
systems, memory footprint (start a Node.js instance for each process is huge, we
have on the roadmap the need to improve this), drivers compatibility and how to
access to other systems (they didn't understand very well the concept of
"open standards"... :-P), but the general feeling is that there's interest on
the project, and some of them were interested in contribute :-) And as a
personal note, I found we need to improve the next point

* add some cool demos working, like
  [blessed-contrib example](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib), simply
  [awesome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib/master/docs/images/term3.gif)
  ... :-D
* improve final user (nsh, console keymaps and fonts...)
* a markdown-to-console parser so the keynotes can run on a NodeOS console :-P

The keynote was recorded and [uploaded to YouTube](http://youtu.be/2osLHwKMaAc),
but unluckily there were some problems and only got recorded the audio :-(
Anyway, you have the slides on the
[NodeOS repository](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/blob/master/doc/NodeOS.odp?raw=true)
:-)
