title: New Site npkg.org

A new site [npkg.org](http://npkg.org/) had been created to help document the growing list of node-os packages.

The site is by no means exhaustive,
since *every* npm package is also a node-os package.
Also the idea of an *official* list of packages is also counter to the idea of a truly open and free package ecosystem.
Despite all that, it's become necessary to itemize the set of packages behind the core system.

The mission behind [npkg.org](http://npkg.org/) is to

1. increase awareness and discovery of packages related to node-os
2. itemize a minimal set of core packages

A core package is anything necessary to get npm working.
This includes mounting file systems, enabling the network, and setting up a default account.

If you would like to list a package, open and issue, or submit a pull-request to the [site repository](https://github.com/npkg/npkg.github.io/).
