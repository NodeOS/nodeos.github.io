# Frequently Asked Questions #

### What is NodeOS
NodeOS is an operating system build entirely in Javascript and managed by npm. Any package in npm is a NodeOS package, which at last count was 301,660 packages. The goal of NodeOS is to provide just enough to let npm provide the rest.
Since anyone can contribute to it, anyone can create NodeOS packages.

### Why does NodeOS dont have a GUI yet?
Currently NodeOS is in Pre-Alpha state (see [Alpha Roadmap](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/issues/37)) we need
to check every box on there to get to the Alpha and after this we need to finish all tasks for the Beta (see [Beta Roadmap](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS/issues/146)).
We're working as fast as we can, but some of us are working full time at other Jobs.
We hope you can understand that we're no magicians. It's basicly like building a House, first you need a stable platform for placing your bricks and after that you can put a Roof on it.
But, if **you** want to create (or dedicate you for) a GUI for NodeOS feel free to Contribute!

### I want to use the NodeOS Logo for a Blog post (or similiar)
You can freely use them for non-profit purposses just by giving attribution to the authors. Third party files are
stored mostly for documental and historic purposses under the concept of "fair use", if not stated otherwise you
should contact the original authors asking for permission to use them beyond personal use.
